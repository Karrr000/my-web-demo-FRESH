# Web Application Project

## Overview
This is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and PHP.
The project focuses on implementing basic backend logic such as user authentication and CRUD operations.

---

## Features
- User login and authentication logic
- Form handling using PHP
- CRUD operation design (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Front-end layout built with HTML and CSS

---
## Live Demo
A static front-end demo is available via GitHub Pages:
> https://karrr000.github.io/my-web-demo-FRESH/index.html

(Note: PHP backend features are not supported on GitHub Pages.)

## Database Note
During development, this project was connected to an online database
for handling user data and CRUD operations.

The database is currently not accessible due to permission changes.
As a result, the backend logic is preserved in the source code,
but the application cannot be fully executed without a database.

Sensitive information such as database credentials
has been removed from the repository.
Configuration files are provided as examples only.
